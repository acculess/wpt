## what mean rectenna?

A rectenna is a type of antenna that is designed to receive and convert radio frequency (RF) energy into direct current (DC) electricity. The rectenna works by harvesting the RF energy from the environment and then converting it into DC power using a rectifier.



## what mean ectenna?

An ectenna is an antenna designed to be embedded in an electronic device. It is used to receive and transmit radio frequency signals, allowing the device to communicate wirelessly with other devices.


## Low-Power WP Harvesting

Power can be transfered by a propagating electromagnetic wave, radiated and received by antennas which do not load each other because they are in each other’s far fields. 

## Medium-Power WPT

Medium-power WPT in several watt ranges at lower frequencies is commer-cially available for personal devices and is typically done reactively at very
short distances through a tightly-coupled transformer using standard circuits
The usual operating frequencies are around 100 kHz, although more recently ISM bands in the 6–27 MHz range have also been used.


High-Power Directive Beaming

To achieve the high power necessary for high-power directive beaming transmitters, two approaches have been considered: solid-state combining in an active phased array and magnetrons. 
There are many works on solid-state phased array, and specifically spatial combining arrays.
The beamforming is very relevant for this application, and for even
higher power levels, magnetron phased-array spatial power combinig

## Rectifiers for High Power at Microwave Frequencies At higher power levels (directive beaming), Schottky diodes can break down, and some researchers demonstrated approaches to distribute the power between multiple diodes. In 100W at 2.45 GHz
