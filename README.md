## what mean rectenna?

A rectenna is a type of antenna that is designed to receive and convert radio frequency (RF) energy into direct current (DC) electricity. The rectenna works by harvesting the RF energy from the environment and then converting it into DC power using a rectifier.



## what mean ectenna?

An ectenna is an antenna designed to be embedded in an electronic device. It is used to receive and transmit radio frequency signals, allowing the device to communicate wirelessly with other devices.


## Low-Power WP Harvesting

Power can be transfered by a propagating electromagnetic wave, radiated and received by antennas which do not load each other because they are in each other’s far fields. 

## Medium-Power WPT

Medium-power WPT in several watt ranges at lower frequencies is commer-cially available for personal devices and is typically done reactively at very
short distances through a tightly-coupled transformer using standard circuits
The usual operating frequencies are around 100 kHz, although more recently ISM bands in the 6–27 MHz range have also been used.
