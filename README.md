## what mean rectenna?

A rectenna is a type of antenna that is designed to receive and convert radio frequency (RF) energy into direct current (DC) electricity. The rectenna works by harvesting the RF energy from the environment and then converting it into DC power using a rectifier.



## what mean ectenna?

An ectenna is an antenna designed to be embedded in an electronic device. It is used to receive and transmit radio frequency signals, allowing the device to communicate wirelessly with other devices.
